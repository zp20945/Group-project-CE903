# PPG Signal Processing and HRV Analysis

This repository contains three Python scripts for processing, filtering, and analyzing Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The scripts include data preprocessing, feature extraction, and PoincarÃ© plot generation for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis.

## Project Overview
The three scripts perform the following tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing & Filtering**: Cleans raw CSV data, applies Butterworth filters, and prepares datasets for further analysis.
2. **HRV Feature Extraction**: Computes HRV time-domain and frequency-domain features from filtered PPG signals.
3. **PoincarÃ© Plot Analysis**: Generates PoincarÃ© plots for HRV analysis and saves the corresponding metrics.

## 1. Data Preprocessing & Filtering (`FilteringAndSplitting.py`)
### **Objective**
- Load and preprocess raw PPG signal data from CSV files.
- Extract respondent name.
- Apply high-pass and low-pass Butterworth filters.
- Filter data based on specific SourceStimuliNames.
- Split 6 specific videos according to specific time intervals, creating 6 videos more. 
- Save the processed data into a new CSV file.

### **Processing Steps**
- Reads a CSV file and removes unnecessary rows.
- Applies a **high-pass filter** to remove baseline drift.
- Uses a **low-pass Butterworth filter** to smooth the signal.
- Filters data based on predefined video stimuli.
- Converts to seconds timestamp values adn splits videos.
- Saves the filtered dataset as `filtered_ppg_signal_with_all_intervals.csv`.

### **Output**
- Processed CSV file containing cleaned and filtered PPG data.

## 2. HRV Feature Extraction (`Extracting_Features.py`)
### **Objective**
- Extract HRV features from PPG signals.
- Compute time-domain and frequency-domain HRV metrics.
- Save the computed HRV features into a CSV file.

### **Processing Steps**
- Loads the filtered PPG signal data.
- Detects **peaks** in the signal using `find_peaks`.
- Computes **RR intervals** from peak-to-peak differences.
- Extracts time-domain HRV features:
  - Mean RR, Median RR, SDNN, RMSSD, NN50, pNN50.
- Computes **power spectral density (PSD)** using Welchâ€™s method.
- Extracts frequency-domain HRV features:
  - VLF, LF, HF power, LF/HF ratio.
- Computes **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**.
- Saves the computed features as `AggregatedFeaturesHRV_38_Videos.csv`.

### **Output**
- CSV file containing HRV metrics for each video stimulus.

## 3. PoincarÃ© Plot Analysis (`PointcarePlot.py`)
### **Objective**
- Generate **PoincarÃ© plots** for visual HRV analysis.
- Compute **SD1**, **SD2**, and **Parasympathetic Index**.
- Save plots and corresponding metrics.

### **Processing Steps**
- Loads filtered PPG data.
- Detects **RR intervals** using peak detection.
- Computes **SD1 and SD2** values from RR intervals.
- Generates **PoincarÃ© plots** using Matplotlib.
- Saves plots and a CSV file containing PoincarÃ© metrics.

### **Output**
- PoincarÃ© plots saved in `Results/PointcarePlots/`.
- CSV file (`PoincareMetrics.csv`) with SD1, SD2, and Parasympathetic Index.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the scripts:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

---
## Usage
Run each script sequentially to process the PPG signals and extract HRV features:
```bash
python script_1.py  # Preprocess and filter data
python script_2.py  # Extract HRV features
python script_3.py  # Generate PoincarÃ© plots
```
